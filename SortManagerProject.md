# Sort Manager Project

## Requirements:

You will be building a program that will allow a user to sort a randomised array. The general flow of the application is:

- The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from.
- Decision is given via the command line (using ```Scanner```).
- The program will then ask for the length of an array again via the command line.
- The program should then output:
	- The unsorted randomly generated array
	- The sort algorithm to be used
	- The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
	- The time taken

You are required to test both the functionality of the program and the performance of the algorithms (speed tests)

## Suggested Project Phases

### Phase 1
- Write a program which will take an array of ```int```s and sort it using a [bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm. +
- Add the option to use a [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) algorithm instead.+
- Include JUnit tests for this and all subsequent phases (and all subsequent projects for the rest of time). 

### Phase 2
- Update your project to use MVC and start to incorporate some of the design principles discussed earlier in the course (OOP, SOLID, design patterns). +
- Create classes which implements MVC, including ```SortManager``` + (controller) and ```DisplayManager``` (view) classes. 
- The code should include a basic factory pattern to determine which sorter to use. +
- Make sure packages are created properly and the structure follows the MVC pattern.
 - The code should separate the business logic (```sorters```) from the ```display``` to show MVC in action. +
 - ```display``` - Classes that deal with printing to the console window.
 - ```exceptions``` - Any custom exceptions which will be thrown.
 - ```sorters``` - The sort algorithms with Sorter interface for the Factory pattern.
 - (Within ```sorters```) ```binaryTree``` - Logic for the binary tree including contract interface (see Phase 4).
 - ```start``` - Factory pattern for sorters, loader for run logic and Java ```main``` method.
- Create an ```interface``` which both sort classes can implement and make sure your application uses this interface where possible.

### Phase 3
- Add logging code into the Sort Manager project.
- Set up ```log4j``` in the project and add a ```.properties``` file.
- Create logs at different levels and fully test the resulting output.
- Have output going to a log file created in the resources directory.
- Ensure there are meaningful log messages added to the project and that they reflect the needs of the levels for which they are set.

### Phase 4
- Integrate a new class to implement a [tree sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_sort), using a [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree), so that the tree sort can be called in the same way as the other sort algorithms.
- The new class should implement the current ```Sorter interface```.
- Add code that calls the BST and passes in the array that will be used to construct the tree and then return a sorted array.
- Use the Facade design pattern for this step.
- Implement a nested class to represent a node in the tree.

### Phase 5
- Add timing information to the project and allow the user to select multiple algorithms to compare their performance.

## Submission
- Code should be hosted on your own Github page with a suitable ```README.md``` file.
- If you want to keep your repo private, add your trainer as a collaborator and email them to say what your GitHub username is.
- A link to your completed project should be emailed to your trainer by 23:59 on 2022-04-24.
